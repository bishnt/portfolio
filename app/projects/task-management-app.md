# Task Management Application

A comprehensive task management solution designed for modern teams, featuring real-time collaboration, intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces, and powerful organizational tools.

## Project Overview

This application addresses the need for efficient team collaboration and project management by providing:

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live updates across all connected users
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Intuitive task organization with visual feedback
- **Team Workspaces**: Separate environments for different projects
- **Advanced Filtering**: Sort and filter tasks by various criteria

## Technical Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with hooks and context for state management
- **TypeScript** for type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **React Beautiful DnD** for drag-and-drop functionality

### Backend
- **Node.js** with Express framework
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose ODM
- **Socket.io** for real-time communication
- **JWT** for authentication and authorization

## Key Features

### Real-time Updates
```javascript
// Socket.io implementation for live updates
socket.on('taskUpdated', (updatedTask) => {
  setTasks(prevTasks => 
    prevTasks.map(task => 
      task.id === updatedTask.id ? updatedTask : task
    )
  );
});
```

### Drag-and-Drop Functionality
Implemented with React Beautiful DnD for smooth task reordering and status changes.

### Team Collaboration
- User roles and permissions
- Comment system on tasks
- Activity tracking and notifications

## Current Progress

- ‚úÖ User authentication system
- ‚úÖ Basic CRUD operations for tasks
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates with Socket.io
- üîÑ Drag-and-drop interface (in progress)
- ‚è≥ Team workspace features (planned)
- ‚è≥ Advanced filtering and search (planned)

## Challenges and Solutions

### Real-time Synchronization
Managing state consistency across multiple clients required careful implementation of Socket.io event handling and optimistic updates.

### Performance Optimization
Large task lists needed virtualization and pagination to maintain smooth user experience.

## Next Steps

1. Complete drag-and-drop implementation
2. Add team invitation system
3. Implement advanced search and filtering
4. Add file attachment capabilities
5. Mobile app development
