## My Thoughts

Volunteering as a content creator at Hult Prize IOE 2025 was an incredible first-year experience that opened my eyes to the world of social entrepreneurship and startup competitions. What started as an opportunity to improve my video editing skills turned into a deep dive into understanding how impactful businesses are conceived, developed, and pitched.

The most valuable part wasn't just the technical skills I gained in video production, but the exposure to real entrepreneurial thinking. Listening to participants pitch their solutions to global problems, watching mentors provide guidance, and seeing how ideas evolve through the competition process gave me insights that no textbook could provide. I learned about market validation, impact measurement, scalability challenges, and the importance of storytelling in entrepreneurship.

Working behind the camera during pitch sessions was particularly educational. I got to observe how successful entrepreneurs present their ideas, handle questions, and adapt their pitches based on feedback. The editing process later allowed me to analyze what made certain presentations more compelling than others, which taught me a lot about effective communication and presentation skills.

The volunteer experience also introduced me to the broader startup ecosystem in Nepal. Through interviews with mentors, judges, and successful alumni, I gained understanding of the challenges and opportunities in Nepal's entrepreneurial landscape. This exposure influenced my perspective on technology's role in solving social problems and sparked interest in building solutions that create meaningful impact.

Most importantly, being part of Hult Prize showed me that business can be a force for good.
