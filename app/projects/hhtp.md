# HTTP Server in C

**Project Name:** HTTP Server in C

**My Role:** Systems Developer

**Tech Used:** C, Socket Programming, HTTP Protocol, Linux, Git

**Description:** 
A lightweight HTTP server implementation built from scratch in C using socket programming. The server handles static page serving, processes GET and POST requests, and delivers static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Built with core networking concepts, the server implements HTTP/1.1 protocol features including request parsing, response generation, file serving capabilities, and basic error handling. The project demonstrates low-level network programming, memory management, and understanding of HTTP protocol specifications without relying on external libraries.

## Project Overview

This HTTP server represents a deep dive into systems programming and network fundamentals. Built entirely in C without external dependencies, it provides hands-on experience with socket programming, HTTP protocol implementation, and server architecture design.

Key features include:

- **HTTP Protocol Implementation**: Full HTTP/1.1 request/response handling
- **Static File Serving**: HTML, CSS, JS, images, and other static assets
- **Request Processing**: GET and POST method support
- **Socket Programming**: Low-level network communication
- **Memory Management**: Efficient C memory allocation and deallocation

## Technical Implementation

### Core Architecture

Built using **C** with POSIX socket APIs:

- TCP socket creation and binding
- Client connection handling and management
- HTTP request parsing from raw socket data
- Response generation with appropriate headers
- File system integration for static content serving

### HTTP Protocol Handling

**Request Processing** implementation:

- Raw HTTP request parsing from socket buffers
- Method extraction (GET, POST) and URL parsing
- Header parsing and validation
- Request body handling for POST requests

### File System Integration

**Static File Serving** capabilities:

- File existence validation and security checks
- MIME type detection based on file extensions
- File reading and streaming to client sockets
- Directory index serving and navigation

## Key Features

### Request Processing System

The server's core functionality includes:

- HTTP method parsing and validation
- URL decoding and path resolution
- Query parameter extraction and processing
- Request header parsing and storage

### Response Generation

Comprehensive HTTP response handling:

- Status code generation (200, 404, 500, etc.)
- Content-Type header setting based on file types
- Content-Length calculation for proper HTTP compliance
- Custom error page serving for various HTTP errors

### Static Content Delivery

Efficient file serving system:

- Multi-format file support (HTML, CSS, JS, images)
- Proper MIME type assignment for different file extensions
- Binary file handling for images and documents
- Caching headers for optimal client-side caching

## Development Process

### Learning Phase

1. **Socket Programming**: Understanding TCP/IP communication in C
2. **HTTP Protocol**: Learning HTTP/1.1 specification and requirements
3. **C Systems Programming**: Memory management and string manipulation
4. **Linux System Calls**: File I/O and network programming APIs

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Memory Management**: Preventing memory leaks in C environment
2. **String Parsing**: Robust HTTP request parsing without external libraries
3. **Concurrent Connections**: Handling multiple client requests efficiently
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and appropriate HTTP responses

## My Thoughts

Building an HTTP server from scratch in C was one of the most educational programming experiences I've had. It stripped away all the abstractions of modern web frameworks and forced me to understand what actually happens when you type a URL in your browser.

The project taught me the fundamentals of network programming - working with raw sockets, understanding TCP/IP communication, and implementing the HTTP protocol manually. Every aspect that we take for granted in modern web development had to be built from the ground up: parsing HTTP requests character by character, generating proper response headers, handling different file types, and managing memory carefully to avoid leaks.

The debugging process was particularly challenging but rewarding. When something went wrong, I couldn't blame a framework or library - it was all my code. This forced me to really understand concepts like buffer management, string manipulation in C, and the intricacies of the HTTP protocol.

What struck me most was how much complexity modern web servers handle behind the scenes. Building even a basic server that properly serves static files while conforming to HTTP standards requires careful attention to edge cases, proper error handling, and efficient resource management. This project gave me a deep appreciation for the engineering that goes into production web servers like Apache and Nginx.

The experience also reinforced my understanding of systems programming concepts and made me more conscious of performance and resource usage in all my subsequent projects.

## Results and Impact

The server successfully demonstrates:

- **Systems Programming Proficiency**: Low-level C programming and memory management
- **Network Protocol Understanding**: HTTP/1.1 implementation from specification
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Building complex functionality without external libraries
- **Code Organization**: Clean, modular C code architecture

### Key Achievements

- **Protocol Compliance**: Proper HTTP/1.1 request/response handling
- **File System Integration**: Secure static file serving with proper MIME types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and graceful failure handling
- **Performance**: Efficient socket programming and memory usage

## Technical Specifications

### Supported Features

- **HTTP Methods**: GET and POST request processing
- **Static Files**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, documents
- **Response Codes**: 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error
- **Content Types**: Automatic MIME type detection and headers
- **Security**: Basic path traversal protection

### Architecture Details

- **Single-threaded**: Synchronous request processing model
- **Socket-based**: Raw TCP socket communication
- **File-based**: Direct file system integration
- **Standards-compliant**: HTTP/1.1 protocol implementation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:

1. **Multi-threading**: Concurrent request handling with pthreads
2. **HTTPS Support**: SSL/TLS encryption implementation
3. **CGI Support**: Dynamic content generation capabilities
4. **Configuration System**: Runtime server configuration options
5. **Logging System**: Request logging and server monitoring
6. **Performance Optimization**: Connection pooling and caching

## Conclusion

This HTTP server project represents a significant milestone in understanding computer networking and systems programming. Building it from scratch in C provided invaluable insights into how web communication actually works at the protocol level. The project demonstrates not just coding ability, but also the patience and problem-solving skills required for low-level systems programming. It's one thing to use Express.js to build a server, but quite another to implement the HTTP protocol yourself - this project bridges that gap and provides a solid foundation for understanding web technology at its core.
