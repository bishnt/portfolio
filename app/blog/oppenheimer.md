# The American Prometheus



> *Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to man. For this, he was chained to a rock and tortured for eternity.*



Prometheus, a Greek Titan, stole fire from Mount Olympus and gave it to humanity. This gift enabled progress and civilization, but it also opened the door to destruction. As punishment, Prometheus was chained to a rock and, being immortal, was condemned to endure daily torture for eternity.

This mythological story draws a powerful parallel with the story of the atomic bomb and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Leading a group of physicists in the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer harnessed two centuries of evolving knowledge in physics and compacted it into a fierce furnace of energy the atomic bomb, a device of mass destruction.

The bomb was born from a race against the Nazis. It was unleashed because everyone believed the Nazis could not be trusted with it. The main emotions that drove the hunger in Oppenheimer for the bomb were a sense of patriotism, an enthusiasm to create something notable, and the ambition to win a Nobel Prize. Maybe if Einstein and Szilard had not written their letter to President Roosevelt, the world today would be different. Without that letter, perhaps we would have had a German Prometheus, Warner Heisenberg of maybe we would never have started the chain reaction to destroy the world. Nazis were the one to ignite the first sparks on the nuclear researches but maybe it was Oppenheimer's destiny to become the one to give us the fire and to ultimately suffer for it.

I consider Oppenheimer a deeply unlucky man. Troubled by thoughts of the universe and homesick during his education,  loved a mentally troubled woman, Jean Tat lock who eventually died by suicide, leaving him with a lasting sense of guilt, as if he had blood on his hands. His second wife, Katherine, struggled with alcoholism. On the very day he published his groundbreaking papers on gravitational contraction, his achievements were overshadowed by Hitler who attacked Poland on the very day. Later, Oppenheimer became the man who brought the world its most dangerous weapon, that could one day destroy the entire world.

Oppenheimer was unknown to the world one day, and the next, he had become one of the most important people in the world. The United States celebrated him for ending the war. The Japanese, remarkably, blamed the one who dropped the bomb and not the one who built it. Yet something haunted him. The patriotism, ambition, and enthusiasm that once drove him had turned into guilt and fear, fear of ending the world with the very device he had create, and guilt from the belief that he had blood on his hands.

He had sought recognition which he always wanted, but perhaps not at the cost of becoming death itself. Oppenheimer had always believed the bomb should be used to show humanity the devastation it could unleash, but he did not foresee the devastation it would bring to his own soul. After building the bomb, he was eventually questioned for his loyalty to the state, especially after the Soviets successfully cloned the bomb, the ultimate betrayal for a man who had once been seen as a national hero. Yet no matter what, he always stood firm in his belief in attaining atomic peace. Perhaps, he took all the devastation the bomb had brought and carried it within himself.

Like Prometheus, Oppenheimer gave humanity a gift it was not ready for, a gift that could both empower and destroy. And like Prometheus, he paid the price, not with chains and rocks, but with the heavy burden of guilt, isolation, and regret.

In the end, Oppenheimer did not simply build a bomb; he unleashed a force that would forever haunt his soul.

Even now, the fire he brought down from the heavens still burns, and we are left to decide whether it will be used to destroy, or to save, the world.
